# dmf_player
This project started life as a possible 6502 SN76489/SMS Deflemask DMF player.
At first I thought the DMF format might be more compact than the VGM format, but unfortunately DMF is gzipped, and when unpacked is quite memory hungry.

So now it is left as just a python parser for the DMF format.
